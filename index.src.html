  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  As the Web platform is extended to enable more useful and powerful
  applications, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that the features
  which enable those applications are enabled only in contexts which meet a minimum
  security bar. This document outlines threat models for feature abuse on the Web
  and outline normative requirements which should be incorporated into documents
  specifying new features.

  The most obvious of the requirements discussed here is that application code
  with access to sensitive or private data be delivered over authenticated and
  confidential channels that guarantee data integrity. Delivering code securely
  cannot ensure that an application will always meet a user's security and
  privacy requirments, but it is a necessary precondition.

      <code>Sufficiently Secure</code> when executed upon it.

      Likewise, a <a>settings object</a> is considered <strong>sufficiently

  An <strong><a>origin</a></strong> defines the scope of authority or privilege
  under which a resource operates. It boils down to a tuple of scheme, host,
  and port. The concept is defined in detail in [[!RFC6454]].

  A <strong><a>potentially secure origin</a></strong> is an origin that isn't
  insecure <i lang="la">a priori</i>, defined in detail in [[!MIX]].

  The <strong><a>TLS State</a></strong> of a <strong>{{Response}}</strong> is
  defined in [[!FETCH]].

  The following terms are defined in [[!HTML5]]:

  <h2 id="is-feature-powerful">
    Is <var>[insert feature here]</var> powerful?
  </h2>

  Certain web platform features that have a distinct impact on a user's
  security or privacy should be available for use only in <a>sufficiently
  secure contexts</a>.

  Broadly speaking, we consider a feature powerful enough to restrict when it
  fits into one or more of the following categories:

  <ol>
    <li>
      The feature provides access to sensitive data (personally-identifying
      information, credentials, payment instruments, and so on).
      [[CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT]] is an example of such an API.
    </li>
    <li>
      The feature provides access to sensor data on a user's device (camera,
      microphone, and GPS being particularly noteworthy, but certainly including
      less obviously dangerous sensors like the accelerometer).
      [[GEOLOCATION-API]] and [[MEDIACAPTURE-STREAMS]] are historical examples.
    </li>
    <li>
      The feature provides access to or information about other devices a user
      has access to. [[DISCOVERY]] and [[BLUETOOTH]] are good examples.
    </li>
    <li>
      The feature exposes temporary or persistent identifiers, including
      identifying hardware features the user can't easily reset.
      [[ENCRYPTED-MEDIA]] for instance.
    </li>
    <li>
      The feature introduces some state for an origin which persists across
      browsing sessions. [[SERVICE-WORKERS]] is a great example.
    </li>
    <li>
      The feature introduces some functionality for which user permission will
      be required.
    </li>
  </ol>

  This list is non-exhaustive, but should give you a feel for the types of
  features you should be concerned about.

  Issue: We need to distinguish between legacy features like cookies,
  <code>localStorage</code>, IndexedDB, etc, which all persist state (and
  potentially identifiers) across browsing sessions. They're certainly not
  features we can reasonably limit to secure contexts in the forseeable future.
  This might involve language along the lines of what mnot@ proposed in
  <a href="https://gist.github.com/mnot/38df717849b775eec3a4/550e9adc5791786ca1c8a0ade72712c466ef6978#adapting-existing-specifications">"Adapting
  Existing Specifications"</a>.

  Note: While restricting the feature itself to <a>sufficiently secure
  contexts</a> is critical, we ought not forget that facilities that carry such
  information (such as new network access mechanisms, or other generic
  functions with access to network data) are equally sensitive.

  <h3 id="threat-models">Threat Models</h3>

  Granting permissions to unauthenticated origins is, in the presence of a
  network attacker, equivalent to granting the permissions to any origin. The
  state of the Internet is such that we must indeed assume that a network
  attacker is present. Generally, network attackers fall into 2 classes:
  passive and active.

  <h4>Passive Network Attacker</h4>

  A "Passive Network Attacker" is a party who is able to observe traffic
  flows but who lacks the ability or chooses not to modify traffic at
  the layers which this specification is concerned with.

  Surveillance of networks in this manner "subverts the intent of communicating
  parties without the agreement of these parties" and one "cannot defend against
  the most nefarious actors while allowing monitoring by other actors no matter
  how benevolent some might consider them to be." [[RFC7258]] Therefore, the
  algorithms defined in this document require mechansims that provide for the
  privacy of data at the application layer, not simply integrity.

  <h4>Active Network Attacker</h4>

  An "Active Network Attacker" has all the capabilities of a "Passive Network
  Attacker" and is additionally able to modify, block or replay any data
  transiting the network.  These capabilties are available to potential
  adversaries at many levels of capability, from compromised devices offering
  or simply participating in public wireless networks, to Internet Service
  Providers indirectly introducing security and privacy vulnerabilities while
  manipulating traffic for financial gain ([[VERIZON]] and [[COMCAST]] are
  recent examples), to parties with direct intent to compromise security or
  privacy who are able to target individual users, organizations or even
  entire populations.

  <section>
    <h3 id="document-sufficiently-secure">
      Is <var>Document</var> a sufficiently secure context?
    </h3>

    Given a {{Document}} <var>document</var>, this algorithm returns
    <code>Sufficiently Secure</code> if the {{Document}} represents a
    <a>sufficiently secure context</a> or <code>Insecure</code> otherwise.

    <ol>
      <li>
        While <var>document</var> corresponds to <a>an iframe srcdoc
        Document</a>, let <var>document</var> be that Document's <a>browsing
        context</a>'s <a>browsing context container</a>'s {{Document}}.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let <var>origin</var> be the <a>origin</a> of <var>document</var>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>document</var>'s active <a>sandboxing flag set</a> has its
        <a>sandboxed origin browsing context flag</a> set:

        <ol>
          <li>
            Set <var>origin</var> to the <a>origin</a> of
            <var>document</var>'s address.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Let <var>result</var> be the result of executing the
        [[#settings-sufficiently-secure]] algorithm on <var>document</var>'s
        <a>incumbent settings object</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>result</var> is <code>Insecure</code>, return
        <code>Insecure</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Otherwise:

        <ol>
          <li>
            If <var>document</var> has an <a>embedding document</a>, return the
            result of executing [[#document-sufficiently-secure]] on
            <var>document</var>'s <a>embedding document</a> with the
            <var>ancestors flag</var> set to <code>true</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Otherwise, return <var>result</var>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    Note: Sandboxed documents will have a unique origin. This algorithm uses the
    location of a sandboxed document to determine whether it should be considered
    authenticated. That is, the document inside
    <code>&lt;iframe src="https://example.com/" sandbox="allow-script"&gt;</code>
    would be considered to allow powerful features.

    Issue: Need to consider how contexts created from blob: and data: are treated
    here, e.g. when used to create a Worker or SharedWorker.

  <section>
    <h3 id="settings-sufficiently-secure">
      Is <var>settings object</var> a sufficiently secure context?
    </h3>

    Given an <a>settings object</a> <var>settings</var>, this algorithm returns
    <code>Sufficiently Secure</code> if the object represents a <a>sufficiently
    secure context</a>, and <code>Insecure</code> otherwise.

    <ol>
      <li>
        If <var>settings</var>' <a>TLS state</a> is
        <code>authenticated</code>, return <code>Sufficiently Secure</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Otherwise:

        <ol>
          <li>
            Let <var>origin</var> be <var>settings</var>' <a>origin</a>.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the result of executing the [[#is-origin-trustworthy]] algorithm
            on <var>origin</var> is <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>, return
            <code>Sufficiently Secure</code>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Return <code>Insecure</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="is-origin-trustworthy">
      Is <var>origin</var> potentially trustworthy?
    </h3>

    Certain origins are always potentially trustworthy. In particular, UAs
    MUST treat <code>file</code> URLs and URLs with hostnames names equivalent
    to "localhost" as potentially trustworthy. In principle the UA could treat
    local files and local web servers as untrustworthy. However, <em>given the
    information that is available to the UA at runtime</em>, the resources
    appear to have been transported securely. Additionally, treating such
    resources as potentially trustworthy is convenient for developers building
    an application before deploying it to the public.

    A user agent MAY choose to extend this trust to other, vendor-specific URL
    schemes like <code>app:</code> or <code>chrome-extension:</code>.

    Given an <a>origin</a> <var>origin</var>, the following algorithm returns
    <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code> or <code>Not Trustworthy</code> as
    appropriate.

    <ol>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var> is a <a>potentially secure origin</a>,
        return <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.

        Note: The origin of <code>blob:</code> and <code>filesystem:</code> URLs
        is the origin of the context in which they were created. Therefore,
        blobs created in an potentially secure origin will themselves be
        potentially secure. The origin of <code>data:</code> and
        <code>javascript:</code> URLs is an opaque identifier, which will not
        be considered potentially secure.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var>'s <code>host</code> component is or falls within
        <code>localhost.</code> [[!RFC6761]], return <code>Potentially
        Trustworthy</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var>'s <code>host</code> component matches one of
        the CIDR notations <code>127.0.0.0/8</code> or <code>::1/128</code>
        [[!RFC4632]], return <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var>'s <code>scheme</code> component is
        <code>file</code>, return <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var>'s <code>scheme</code> component is one which
        the user agent considers to be authenticated, return
        <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.

        Note: See [[#packaged-applications]] for detail here.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var> has been configured as a trustworthy origin,
        return <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.

        Note: See [[#development-environments]] for detail here.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return <code>Not Trusted</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>

  <h2 id="implementation-considerations">Implementation Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="packaged-applications">Packaged Applications</h3>

  User agents that support packaged applications MAY whitelist specific URL
  schemes whose contents are authenticated by the user agent. For example,
  FirefoxOS application resources are referred to by a URL whose
  <code>scheme</code> component is <code>app:</code>. Likewise, Chrome's
  extensions and apps live on <code>chrome-extension:</code> schemes. These
  could reasonably be considered trusted origins.

  <h3 id="development-environments">Development Environments</h3>

  In order to support developers who run staging servers on non-loopback hosts,
  user agents MAY allow users to configure specific sets of origins as
  trustworthy, even though [[#is-origin-trustworthy]] would normally return
  <code>Not Trusted</code>.
