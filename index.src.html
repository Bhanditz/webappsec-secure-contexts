  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  As the Web platform is extended to enable more useful and powerful
  applications, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that the features
  which enable those applications are enabled only in contexts which meet a minimum
  security bar. This document outlines threat models for feature abuse on the Web
  and outline normative requirements which should be incorporated into documents
  specifying new features.

  The most obvious of the requirements discussed here is that application code
  with access to sensitive or private data be delivered over authenticated and
  confidential channels that guarantee data integrity. Delivering code securely
  cannot ensure that an application will always meet a user's security and
  privacy requirements, but it is a necessary precondition.

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

    }
  </style>

  <h4 id="examples-top-level">Top-level Documents</h4>

  Top-level documents are secure on their own merits:

  <div class="example">
    <p><code>https://example.com/</code> opened in a <a>top-level browsing
    context</a> is a <a>secure context</a>, as it was delivered over
    an authenticated and encrypted channel.</p>

    <svg width="400" height="200">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="297" y="0" x="0" class="secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://example.com/</text>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    <p><code>http://insecure.example.com/</code> opened in a <a>top-level
    browsing context</a> pops open a new window containing
    <code>https://example.com/</code>. The former is insecure, the latter is
    a <a>secure context</a>, as it was delivered over an authenticated and
    encrypted channel. The opener context doesn't play into this check.</p>

    <svg width="400" height="400">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="297" y="0" x="0" class="insecure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">http://insecure.example.com/</text>
      </g>
      <g transform="translate(10,210)">
        <rect height="175" width="297" y="0" x="0" class="secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://example.com/</text>
      </g>
      <g>
        <path d="M150, 87 C 200 75, 350 75, 150 287"></path>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>

  
  <h4 id="examples-framed">Framed Documents</h4>

  Framed documents can be <a>secure contexts</a> if they are delivered from
  <a>potentially trustworthy</a> origins, <em>and</em> if they're embedded
  in a <a>secure context</a>. That is:

  <div class="example">
    <p> if
    <code>https://example.com/</code> opened in a <a>top-level browsing
    context</a> opens <code>https://sub.example.com/</code> in a frame, then
    both are <a>secure contexts</a>, as both were delivered over
    authenticated and encrypted channels.</p>

    <svg width="400" height="200">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="300" y="0" x="0" class="secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://example.com/</text>
        <g transform="translate(20, 50)">
          <rect height="105" width="250" y="0" x="0" class="secure" />
          <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://sub.example.com/</text>
        </g>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>
  <div class="example">
    <p>If <code>https://example.com/</code> was somehow able to frame
    <code>http://insecure.example.com/</code> (perhaps the user has
    overridden mixed content checking?), the top-level frame would remain
    secure, but the framed content would <em>not</em> be considered a secure
    context.</p>

    <svg width="400" height="200">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="300" y="0" x="0" class="secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://example.com/</text>
        <g transform="translate(20, 50)">
          <rect height="105" width="250" y="0" x="0" class="insecure" />
          <text transform="translate(10, 20)">http://insecure.example.com/</text>
        </g>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>
  <div class="example">
    <p>If, on the other hand, <code>https://example.com/</code> is framed
    inside of <code>http://insecure.example.com/</code>, then it is
    <em>not</em> considered to be a secure context, as its ancestor is not
    delivered over an authenticated and encrypted channel.</p>

    <svg width="400" height="200">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="300" y="0" x="0" class="insecure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">http://insecure.example.com/</text>
        <g transform="translate(20, 50)">
          <rect height="105" width="250" y="0" x="0" class="insecure" />
          <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://example.com/</text>
        </g>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>

  <h4 id="examples-workers">Web Workers</h4>

  Dedicated Web Workers are similar in nature to framed documents. They're
  considered secure when they're delivered from <a>potentially trustworthy</a>
  origins, and when their owner is itself a <a>secure context</a>:

  <div class="example">
    <p>If <code>https://example.com/</code> in a <a>top-level browsing
    context</a> runs <code>https://example.com/worker.js</code>, then
    both the document and the worker are considered secure contexts.</p>

    <svg width="600" height="200">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="300" y="0" x="0" class="secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://example.com/</text>
        <g transform="translate(400, 110)">
          <circle r="50" class="secure" />
          <text transform="translate(-75, -55)">https://example.com/worker.js</text>
        </g>
        <g>
          <path d="M150, 87 C 200 75, 350 75, 405 110"></path>
        </g>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    <p>If <code>http://insecure.example.com/</code> in a <a>top-level browsing
    context</a> frames <code>https://example.com/</code>, which runs
    <code>https://example.com/worker.js</code>, then neither the framed document
    nor the worker are considered secure contexts.</p>

    <svg width="600" height="200">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="297" y="0" x="0" class="insecure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">http://insecure.example.com/</text>
        <g transform="translate(20, 50)">
          <rect height="105" width="250" y="0" x="0" class="insecure" />
          <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://example.com/</text>
        </g>
        <g transform="translate(400, 110)">
          <circle r="50" class="insecure" />
          <text transform="translate(-75, -55)">https://example.com/worker.js</text>
        </g>
        <g>
          <path d="M150, 87 C 200 75, 350 75, 405 110"></path>
        </g>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>

  <h4 id="examples-shared-workers">Shared Workers</h4>

  Shared Workers can have multiple contexts attached, so their behavior is a
  bit special. In short, if a Shared Worker is created from a secure context,
  it is a secure context, and may only be connected to by other secure
  contexts. If a Shared Worker is created from an insecure context, it is an
  insecure context, and may only be connected to by other insecure contexts.

  <div class="example">
    <p>If <code>https://example.com/</code> in a <a>top-level browsing
    context</a> runs <code>https://example.com/worker.js</code> as a Shared
    Worker, then both the document and the worker are considered secure
    contexts.</p>

    <svg width="600" height="200">
      <g transform="translate(10,10)">
        <rect height="175" width="300" y="0" x="0" class="secure" />
        <text transform="translate(10, 20)">https://example.com/</text>
        <g transform="translate(400, 110)">
          <circle r="50" class="secure" />

        </g>
      </g>
    </svg>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    <p>If <code>https://example.com/</code> in a different <a>top-level
    browsing context</a> (e.g. in a new window) is a secure context, so it may

  <h4 id="examples-service-workers">Service Workers</h4>

  Service Workers are always secure contexts, which is reasonably safe to do,
  since they may only be registered from secure contexts, and may only have
  clients which are secure contexts.

  <div class="example">
    <p>If <code>https://example.com/</code> in a <a>top-level browsing
    context</a> registers <code>https://example.com/service.js</code>,
    then both the document and the Service Worker are considered secure
    contexts.</p>

  A <a>settings object</a> is considered a <dfn export>secure context</dfn> if
  the algorithm in [[#settings-object]] returns "`Secure`".

  <h3 id="monkey-patching">Modifications to HTML</h3>

  <h4 id="monkey-patching-shared-workers">Shared Workers</h4>

  During execution of the {{SharedWorker()}} constructor, a `SecurityError`
  will be thrown if a <a>secure context</a> attempts to attach to an
  Worker which is not a <a>secure context</a>, and if an insecure context
  attempts to attach to a Worker which is a <a>secure context</a>. The
  constructor is modified as follows:

  1.  As the first substep of the {{SharedWorker()}} constructor's current step
      7.7 ("If <var>worker global scope</var> is not `null`, then run these
      steps:"), run the following step:

      1.  If the result of executing [[#settings-object]] on the <a>incumbent
          settings object</a> does not match the result of executing the same
          algorithm on <var>worker global scope</var>'s <a>relevant settings
          object</a>, then throw a `SecurityError` exception, and abort
          the remaining steps.

  <h4 id="monkey-patching-global-object">Feature Detection</h4>

  To determine whether a context is capable of making use of features which
  require <a>secure contexts</a>, a simple boolean attribute is added to the
  global object:

  <pre class="idl">
    partial interface Window {
      readonly attribute boolean isSecureContext;
    };

    partial interface WorkerGlobalScope {
      readonly attribute boolean isSecureContext;
    };
  </pre>

  Both {{Window}}'s {{Window/isSecureContext}} and {{WorkerGlobalScope}}'s
  {{WorkerGlobalScope/isSecureContext}} attribute's getters return

  <h3 id="settings-object">
    Is <var>settings object</var> a secure context?
  </h3>

  Given a <a>settings object</a> (<var>settings</var>), this algorithm returns
  "`Secure`" if the object represents a context which can be trusted as being
  delivered securely, and "`Not Secure`" otherwise.

  1.  Let <var>ancestors</var> be a list containing <var>settings</var>.

  2.  If <var>settings</var>' <a>global object</a> is a {{WorkerGlobalScope}},
      then:

      1.  For each {{Document}} (<var>document</var>) in <var>settings</var>'
          <a>global object</a>'s list of <a>the worker's
          <code>Documents</code></a>:

          1.  Add each item in the result of executing [[#gather-ancestors]] on
              <var>document</var> to <var>ancestors</var>.

  3.  Otherwise, <var>settings</var>' <a>global object</a> is a
      {{Window}}, so:

      1.  Add each item in the result of executing [[#gather-ancestors]] on
          <var>settings</var>' <a>responsible document</a> to
          <var>ancestors</var>.

  4.  For each <var>ancestor settings</var> in <var>ancestors</var>:

      1.  If <var>ancestor settings</var>'s <a>HTTPS state</a> is "`modern`",
          skip to the next <var>ancestor settings</var>.

      2.  Let <var>origin</var> be <var>ancestor settings</var>' <a>origin</a>.

      3.  If <var>origin</var> is a <a>globally unique identifier</a>, set
          <var>origin</var> to the <a lt="origin of a url">origin</a>
          of <var>settings</var>'s <a>creation URL</a>.

          Note: We use the origin of the URL here in order to allow sandboxed
          context to remain secure (as sandboxing is a strict reduction in the
          context's capabilities, and therefore risk). This covers scenarios
          such as `&lt;iframe sandbox src="http://localhost/"&gt;`.

      4.  If the result of executing the [[#is-origin-trustworthy]] algorithm
          on <var>origin</var> is <strong>not</strong> `Potentially
          Trustworthy`, then return "`Not Secure`".

  5.  Return "`Secure`".

  <h3 id="is-origin-trustworthy">
    Is <var>origin</var> potentially trustworthy?
  </h3>

  Certain origins are always <dfn>potentially trustworthy</dfn>. In
  particular, UAs MUST treat <code>file</code> URLs and URLs with hostnames
  names equivalent to "localhost" as potentially trustworthy. In principle
  the UA could treat local files and local web servers as untrustworthy.
  However, <em>given the information that is available to the UA at
  runtime</em>, the resources appear to have been transported securely.
  Additionally, treating such resources as potentially trustworthy is
  convenient for developers building an application before deploying it to
  the public.

  A user agent MAY choose to extend this trust to other, vendor-specific URL
  schemes like <code>app:</code> or <code>chrome-extension:</code>.

  Given an <a>origin</a> <var>origin</var>, the following algorithm returns
  <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code> or <code>Not Trustworthy</code> as
  appropriate.

  1.  If <var>origin</var> is a <a>potentially secure origin</a>, return
      <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.

      Note: The origin of <code>blob:</code> and <code>filesystem:</code> URLs
      is the origin of the context in which they were created. Therefore,
      blobs created in an potentially secure origin will themselves be
      potentially secure. The origin of <code>data:</code> and
      <code>javascript:</code> URLs is an opaque identifier, which will not
      be considered potentially secure.

  2.  If <var>origin</var>'s <code>host</code> component is or falls within
      <code>localhost.</code> [[!RFC6761]], return <code>Potentially
      Trustworthy</code>.

  3.  If <var>origin</var>'s <code>host</code> component matches one of
      the CIDR notations <code>127.0.0.0/8</code> or <code>::1/128</code>
      [[!RFC4632]], return <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.

  4.  If <var>origin</var>'s <code>scheme</code> component is
      <code>file</code>, return <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.

  5.  If <var>origin</var>'s <code>scheme</code> component is one which
      the user agent considers to be authenticated, return
      <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.

      Note: See [[#packaged-applications]] for detail here.

  6.  If <var>origin</var> has been configured as a trustworthy origin,
      return <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.

      Note: See [[#development-environments]] for detail here.

  7.  Return <code>Not Trusted</code>.

  <h3 id="gather-ancestors">
    Gather <var>document</var>'s relevant ancestors
  </h3>

  Given a {{Document}} (<var>document</var>), this algorithm returns a list of
  <a>settings objects</a> which ought to be considered when determining whether
  or not <var>document</var> is a <a>secure context</a>.

  1.  Let <var>ancestors</var> be a list containing <var>document</var>'s
      <a>relevant settings object</a>.

  2.  While <var>document</var> has a <a>creator <code>Document</code></a>
      <var>creator</var>:

      1.  If <var>creator</var>'s <a>browsing context</a> is an <a>ancestor
          browsing context</a> of <var>document</var>:

          1.  Insert <var>creator</var>'s <a>relevant settings object</a> into
              <var>ancestors</var>, unless <var>creator</var> is <a>an IFrame
              `srcdoc` `Document`</a>.

          2.  Let <var>document</var> be <var>creator</var>.

      2.  Otherwise, exit this loop.

  3.  Return <var>ancestors</var>.

  Note: When gathering a {{Document}}'s ancestors, we walk the browsing context
  creation document chain, but stop when that chain spans across more than one
  {{Window}}. That is, a newly opened window is evaluated on its own merits,
  without regard for the status of the opener.

  <h2 id="threat-models-risks">
    Threat models and risks
  </h2>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  <h3 id="threat-models">Threat Models</h3>

  Granting permissions to unauthenticated origins is, in the presence of a
  network attacker, equivalent to granting the permissions to any origin. The
  state of the Internet is such that we must indeed assume that a network
  attacker is present. Generally, network attackers fall into 2 classes:
  passive and active.

  <h4 id="threat-passive">Passive Network Attacker</h4>

  A "Passive Network Attacker" is a party who is able to observe traffic
  flows but who lacks the ability or chooses not to modify traffic at
  the layers which this specification is concerned with.

  Surveillance of networks in this manner "subverts the intent of communicating
  parties without the agreement of these parties" and one "cannot defend against
  the most nefarious actors while allowing monitoring by other actors no matter
  how benevolent some might consider them to be." [[RFC7258]] Therefore, the
  algorithms defined in this document require mechansims that provide for the
  privacy of data at the application layer, not simply integrity.

  <h4 id="threat-active">Active Network Attacker</h4>

  An "Active Network Attacker" has all the capabilities of a "Passive Network
  Attacker" and is additionally able to modify, block or replay any data
  transiting the network.  These capabilities are available to potential
  adversaries at many levels of capability, from compromised devices offering
  or simply participating in public wireless networks, to Internet Service
  Providers indirectly introducing security and privacy vulnerabilities while
  manipulating traffic for financial gain ([[VERIZON]] and [[COMCAST]] are
  recent examples), to parties with direct intent to compromise security or
  privacy who are able to target individual users, organizations or even
  entire populations.

  <h3 id="threat-risks">Risks associated with insecure contexts</h3>

  Certain web platform features that have a distinct impact on a user's
  security or privacy should be available for use only in <a>secure
  contexts</a> in order to defend against the threats above. Features
  available in insecure contexts risk exposing these capabilities to
  network attackers:

  <ol>
    <li>
      The ability to read and modify sensitive data (personally-identifying
      information, credentials, payment instruments, and so on).
      [[CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT]] is an example of an API that handles sensitive
      data.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to read and modify input from sensors on a user's device
      (camera, microphone, and GPS being particularly noteworthy, but
      certainly including less obviously dangerous sensors like the
      accelerometer). [[GEOLOCATION-API]] and [[MEDIACAPTURE-STREAMS]] are
      historical examples of features that use sensor input.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to access information about other devices a user
      has access to. [[DISCOVERY]] and [[BLUETOOTH]] are good examples.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to track users using temporary or persistent identifiers,
      including identifiers which reset themselves after some period of time
      (e.g. {{sessionStorage}}), identifiers the user can manually reset
      (e.g. [[ENCRYPTED-MEDIA]], Cookies [[RFC6265]], and [[IndexedDB]]),
      as well as identifying hardware features the user can't easily reset.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to introduce some state for an origin which persists across
      browsing sessions. [[SERVICE-WORKERS]] is a great example.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to manipulate a user agent's native UI in some way which
      removes, obscures, or manipulates details relevant to a user's
      understanding of their context. [[FULLSCREEN]], for instance.
    </li>
    <li>
      The ability to introduce some functionality for which user permission will
      be required.
    </li>
  </ol>

  This list is non-exhaustive, but should give you a feel for the types of
  risks we should consider when writing or implementing specifications.

  Note: While restricting a feature itself to <a>secure contexts</a> is
  critical, we ought not forget that facilities that carry such information
  (such as new network access mechanisms, or other generic functions with access
  to network data) are equally sensitive.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="security-considerations">Security Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="isolation">Incomplete Isolation</h3>

  The <a>secure context</a> definition in this document does not completely
  isolate a "secure" view on an origin from an "insecure" view on the same
  origin. That is, a developer who is actively working to bypass the secure
  context restriction on a particular API will be able to create a
  `postMessage`-based shim if they're willing to pop up a new window
  and rely on its persistence (as the new window will be a new top-level
  browsing context, and will be evaluated without regard for the opener's
  state).

  More esoteric exfiltration methods will be available as well, ranging from
  shared `localStorage` and related `storage` events to `window.name` tricks.
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="implementation-considerations">Implementation Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="packaged-applications">Packaged Applications</h3>

  User agents that support packaged applications MAY whitelist specific URL
  schemes whose contents are authenticated by the user agent. For example,
  FirefoxOS application resources are referred to by a URL whose
  <a for="URL">scheme</a> component is `app:`. Likewise, Chrome's extensions
  and apps live on `chrome-extension:` schemes. These could reasonably be
  considered trusted origins.

  <h3 id="development-environments">Development Environments</h3>

  In order to support developers who run staging servers on non-loopback hosts,
  user agents MAY allow users to configure specific sets of origins as
  trustworthy, even though [[#is-origin-trustworthy]] would normally return
  `Not Trusted`.

  <h3 id="new">Restricting New Features</h3>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  When writing a specification for new features, we recommend that authors
  and editors guard sensitive APIs with checks against <a>secure contexts</a>.
  For example, something like the following might be a good approach:

  <div class="example">
    <ol>
      <li>
        If the <a>incumbent settings object</a> is <em>not</em> a <a>secure
        context</a>, then:
     
        <ol>
          <li>
            [<i>insert something appropriate here: perhaps a Promise could be
            rejected with a `SecurityError`, an error callback could be called,
            a permission request denied, etc.</i>].
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </div>

  <h3 id="legacy">Restricting Legacy Features</h3>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  The list above clearly includes some existing functionality that is currently
  available to the web over insecure channels. We recommend that such legacy
  functionality begin requiring a <a>secure context</a> as quickly as is
  reasonably possible.

  1.  If such a feature is not widely implemented, we recommend that the
      specification be immediately
      <a lt="modify a specification">modified</a> to include a restriction
      to <a>secure contexts</a>.

  2.  If such a feature is widely implemented, but not yet in wide use, we
      recommend that it be quickly restricted to <a>secure contexts</a> by
      adding a check as described in [[#new]] to existing implementations, and
      <a lt="modify a specification">modifying the specification</a>
      accordingly.

  3.  If such a feature is in wide use, we recommend that the existing
      functionality be deprecated; the specification should be
      <a lt="modify a specification">modified</a> to note that it does not
      conform to the restrictions outlined in this document, and a plan should
      be developed to both offer a conformant version of the feature and to
      migrate existing users into that new version.

  <h4 id="legacy-example">Example: Geolocation</h4>

  The [[GEOLOCATION-API]] is a good concrete example of such an feature; it is
  widely implemented and used on a large number of insecure sites. A reasonable
  path forward might look like this:

  1.  <a lt="modify a specification">Modify</a> the specification to include
      checks against <a>secure context</a> before executing the algorithms for
      {{getCurrentPosition()}} and {{watchPosition()}}.

      If the <a>incumbent settings object</a> is not a <a>secure context</a>,
      then the algorithms should be aborted, and the <var>errorCallback</var>
      invoked with a `code` of `PERMISSION_DENIED`.

  2.  User agents should announce clear intentions to disable the API for
      insecure contexts on a specific date, and warn developers accordingly
      (via console messages, for example).

  3.  Leading up to the flag day, user agents should announce a deprecation
      schedule to ensure both that site authors recognize the need to modify
      their code before it simply stops working altogether, and to protect
      users in the meantime. Such a plan might include any or all of:

      1.  Disallowing persistent permission grants to insecure origins

      2.  Coarsening the accuracy of the API for insecure origins (perhaps
          consistently returning city-level data rather than high-accuracy
          data)

      3.  UI modifications to inform users and site authors of the risk
