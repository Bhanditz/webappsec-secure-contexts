  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  As the Web platform is extended to enable more useful and powerful
  applications, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that the features
  which enable those applications are enabled only in contexts which meet a minimum
  security bar. This document outlines threat models for feature abuse on the Web
  and outline normative requirements which should be incorporated into documents
  specifying new features.

  The most obvious of the requirements discussed here is that application code
  with access to sensitive or private data be delivered over authenticated and
  confidential channels that guarantee data integrity. Delivering code securely
  cannot ensure that an application will always meet a user's security and
  privacy requirments, but it is a necessary precondition.

    <dd>
      A {{Document}} is considered <strong>sufficiently secure</strong> if
      the algorithm defined in [[#document-sufficiently-secure]] returns
      <code>Sufficiently Secure</code> when executed upon it.

      Likewise, a <a>settings object</a> is considered <strong>sufficiently
      secure</strong> if the algorithm defined in
      [[#settings-sufficiently-secure]] returns <code>Sufficiently
      Secure</code> when executed upon it.

    <dt><dfn>embedding document</dfn></dt>
    <dd>
      Given a {{Document}} <var>A</var>, the <strong>embedding

    </dd>
  </dl>

  <h3 id="terms-defined-by-reference">Terms defined by reference</h3>

  An <strong><a>origin</a></strong> defines the scope of authority or privilege
  under which a resource operates. It boils down to a tuple of scheme, host,
  and port. The concept is defined in detail in [[!RFC6454]].

  A <strong><a>potentially secure origin</a></strong> is an origin that isn't
  insecure <i lang="la">a priori</i>, defined in detail in [[!MIX]].

  The <strong><a>TLS State</a></strong> of a <strong>{{Response}}</strong> is
  defined in [[!FETCH]].

  The following terms are defined in [[!HTML5]]:

  <ul>
    <li><strong><a>an iframe srcdoc document</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a>browsing context</a></strong></li>
    <li><strong><a>browsing context container</a></strong></li>

<section>
  <h2 id="is-feature-powerful">
    Is <var>[insert feature here]</var> powerful?
  </h2>

  Certain web platform features that have a distinct impact on a user's
  security or privacy should be available for use only in <a>sufficiently
  secure contexts</a>.

  Broadly speaking, we consider a feature powerful enough to restrict when it
  fits into one or more of the following categories:

  <ol>
    <li>
      The feature provides access to sensitive data (personally-identifying
      information, credentials, payment instruments, and so on).
      [[CREDENTIAL-MANAGEMENT]] is an example of such an API.
    </li>
    <li>
      The feature provides access to sensor data on a user's device (camera,
      microphone, and GPS being particularly noteworthy, but certainly including
      less obviously dangerous sensors like the accelerometer).
      [[GEOLOCATION-API]] and [[MEDIACAPTURE-STREAMS]] are historical examples.
    </li>
    <li>
      The feature provides access to or information about other devices a user
      has access to. [[DISCOVERY]] and [[BLUETOOTH]] are good examples.
    </li>
    <li>
      The feature exposes temporary or persistent identifiers, including
      identifiers which reset themselves after some period of time
      (e.g. {{sessionStorage}}), identifiers the user can manually reset
      (e.g. [[ENCRYPTED-MEDIA]], Cookies [[RFC6265]], and [[IndexedDB]]),
      as well as identifying hardware features the user can't easily reset.
    </li>
    <li>
      The feature introduces some state for an origin which persists across
      browsing sessions. [[SERVICE-WORKERS]] is a great example.
    </li>
    <li>
      The feature introduces some functionality for which user permission will
      be required.
    </li>
  </ol>

  This list is non-exhaustive, but should give you a feel for the types of
  features we should be concerned about when writing or implementing
  specifications.

  Note: While restricting the feature itself to <a>sufficiently secure
  contexts</a> is critical, we ought not forget that facilities that carry such
  information (such as new network access mechanisms, or other generic
  functions with access to network data) are equally sensitive.

  <h3 id="threat-models">Threat Models</h3>

  Granting permissions to unauthenticated origins is, in the presence of a
  network attacker, equivalent to granting the permissions to any origin. The
  state of the Internet is such that we must indeed assume that a network
  attacker is present. Generally, network attackers fall into 2 classes:
  passive and active.

  <h4>Passive Network Attacker</h4>

  A "Passive Network Attacker" is a party who is able to observe traffic
  flows but who lacks the ability or chooses not to modify traffic at
  the layers which this specification is concerned with.

  Surveillance of networks in this manner "subverts the intent of communicating
  parties without the agreement of these parties" and one "cannot defend against
  the most nefarious actors while allowing monitoring by other actors no matter
  how benevolent some might consider them to be." [[RFC7258]] Therefore, the
  algorithms defined in this document require mechansims that provide for the
  privacy of data at the application layer, not simply integrity.

  <h4>Active Network Attacker</h4>

  An "Active Network Attacker" has all the capabilities of a "Passive Network
  Attacker" and is additionally able to modify, block or replay any data
  transiting the network.  These capabilties are available to potential
  adversaries at many levels of capability, from compromised devices offering
  or simply participating in public wireless networks, to Internet Service
  Providers indirectly introducing security and privacy vulnerabilities while
  manipulating traffic for financial gain ([[VERIZON]] and [[COMCAST]] are
  recent examples), to parties with direct intent to compromise security or
  privacy who are able to target individual users, organizations or even
  entire populations.

<section>
  <h2 id="restrictions">Restricting Features</h2>

  <h3 id="new">New Features</h3>

  When writing a specification for a new features, we recommend that authors
  and editors guard sensitive APIs with checks against
  [[#document-sufficiently-secure]] or [[#settings-sufficiently-secure]], as
  appropriate for the context. For example, something like the following would
  be a good approach:

  <div class="example">
    If we can get to a {{Document}}, we should prefer it for the check, as it
    allows us to verify the whole ancestor chain. If we don't have a
    {{Document}} (because we're executing code inside a Service Worker or
    Shared Worker, for instance), then checking the settings object is the best
    we can do:

    <ol>
      <li>
        Let <var>settings</var> be the <a>incumbent settings object</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>settings</var> has a <a>responsible document</a>
        <var>document</var>, then let <var>result</var> to the result of
        executing [[#document-sufficiently-secure]] on <var>document</var>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Otherwise, <var>settings</var> has no <a>responsible document</a>:
        Let <var>result</var> to the result of executing
        [[#settings-sufficiently-secure]] on <var>settings</var>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>result</var> is <code>Insecure</code>, then [<i>insert
        something appropriate here: perhaps you could reject a Promise,
        call an error callback, deny a permission request, etc.</i>].
      </li>
    </ol>

    Note: If you choose to copy/paste the above text for your spec, do remember
    to put an action appropriate for your use case into step #4 in place of the
    placeholder text.
  </div>

  <h3 id="legacy">Legacy Features</h3>

  The list above clearly includes some existing functionality that is currently
  available to the web over insecure channels. We recommend that such legacy
  functionality begin requiring a <a>sufficiently secure context</a> as quickly
  as is reasonably possible.

  <ol>
    <li>
      If such a feature is not widely implemented, we recommend that the
      specification be immediately
      <a title="modify a specification">modified</a> to include a restriction
      to <a>sufficiently secure contexts</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      If such a feature is widely implemented, but not yet in wide use, we
      recommend that it be quickly restricted to <a>sufficiently secure
      contexts</a> by adding a check as described in [[#new]] to existing
      implementations, and <a title="modify a specification">modifying the
      specification</a> accordingly.
    </li>
    <li>
      If such a feature is in wide use, we recommend that the existing
      functionality be deprecated; the specification should be
      <a title="modify a specification">modified</a> to note that it does not
      conform to the restrictions outlined in this document, and a plan should
      be developed to both offer a conformant version of the feature and to
      migrate existing users into that new version.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h4 id="legacy-example">Example: Geolocation</h4>

  The [[GEOLOCATION-API]] is a good concrete example of such an feature; it is
  widely implemented and used on a large number of insecure sites. A reasonable
  path forward might look like this:

  <ol>
    <li>
      <a title="modify a specification">Modify</a> the specification to include
      checks against [[#settings-sufficiently-secure]] before executing the
      algorithms for {{getCurrentPosition()}} and {{watchPosition()}}.

      If [[#settings-sufficiently-secure]] returns <code>Insecure</code>, then
      the algorithms should be aborted, and the <var>errorCallback</var> invoked
      with a <code>code</code> of <code>PERMISSION_DENIED</code>.
    </li>
    <li>
      User agents should announce clear intentions to disable the API for
      insecure contexts on a specific date, and warn developers accordingly
      (via console messages, for example).
    </li>
    <li>
      Leading up to the flag day, user agents should announce a deprecation
      schedule to ensure both that site authors recognize the need to modify
      their code before it simply stops working altogether, and to protect
      users in the meantime. Such a plan might include:

      <ul>
        <li>
          Disallowing persistent permission grants to insecure origins
        </li>
        <li>
          Coarsening the accuracy of the API for insecure origins (perhaps
          consistently returning city-level data rather than high-accuracy
          data)
        </li>
        <li>
          UI modifications to inform users and site authors of the risk
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h2>

  <section>
    <h3 id="document-sufficiently-secure">
      Is <var>Document</var> a sufficiently secure context?
    </h3>

    Given a {{Document}} <var>document</var>, this algorithm returns
    <code>Sufficiently Secure</code> if the {{Document}} represents a
    <a>sufficiently secure context</a> or <code>Insecure</code> otherwise.

    <ol>
      <li>
        While <var>document</var> corresponds to <a>an iframe srcdoc
        Document</a>, let <var>document</var> be that Document's <a>browsing
        context</a>'s <a>browsing context container</a>'s {{Document}}.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let <var>origin</var> be the <a>origin</a> of <var>document</var>.

      <li>
        If <var>document</var>'s active <a>sandboxing flag set</a> has its

        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        Let <var>result</var> be the result of executing the
        [[#settings-sufficiently-secure]] algorithm on <var>document</var>'s
        <a>incumbent settings object</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>result</var> is <code>Insecure</code>, return
        <code>Insecure</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Otherwise:

        <ol>
          <li>
            If <var>document</var> has an <a>embedding document</a>, return the
            result of executing [[#document-sufficiently-secure]] on
            <var>document</var>'s <a>embedding document</a> with the
            <var>ancestors flag</var> set to <code>true</code>.
          </li>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    Note: Sandboxed documents will have a unique origin. This algorithm uses the
    location of a sandboxed document to determine whether it should be considered
    authenticated. That is, the document inside
    <code>&lt;iframe src="https://example.com/" sandbox="allow-script"&gt;</code>
    would be considered to allow powerful features.

    Issue: Need to consider how contexts created from blob: and data: are treated
    here, e.g. when used to create a Worker or SharedWorker.

    Certain origins are always potentially trustworthy. In particular, UAs
    MUST treat <code>file</code> URLs and URLs with hostnames names equivalent
    to "localhost" as potentially trustworthy. In principle the UA could treat
    local files and local web servers as untrustworthy. However, <em>given the
    information that is available to the UA at runtime</em>, the resources
    appear to have been transported securely. Additionally, treating such
    resources as potentially trustworthy is convenient for developers building
    an application before deploying it to the public.

    A user agent MAY choose to extend this trust to other, vendor-specific URL
    schemes like <code>app:</code> or <code>chrome-extension:</code>.

    Given an <a>origin</a> <var>origin</var>, the following algorithm returns
    <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code> or <code>Not Trustworthy</code> as
    appropriate.

    <ol>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var> is a <a>potentially secure origin</a>,
        return <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.

        Note: The origin of <code>blob:</code> and <code>filesystem:</code> URLs
        is the origin of the context in which they were created. Therefore,
        blobs created in an potentially secure origin will themselves be
        potentially secure. The origin of <code>data:</code> and
        <code>javascript:</code> URLs is an opaque identifier, which will not
        be considered potentially secure.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var>'s <code>host</code> component is or falls within
        <code>localhost.</code> [[!RFC6761]], return <code>Potentially
        Trustworthy</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var>'s <code>host</code> component matches one of
        the CIDR notations <code>127.0.0.0/8</code> or <code>::1/128</code>
        [[!RFC4632]], return <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var>'s <code>scheme</code> component is
        <code>file</code>, return <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var>'s <code>scheme</code> component is one which
        the user agent considers to be authenticated, return
        <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.

        Note: See [[#packaged-applications]] for detail here.
      </li>
      <li>
        If <var>origin</var> has been configured as a trustworthy origin,
        return <code>Potentially Trustworthy</code>.

        Note: See [[#development-environments]] for detail here.
      </li>
      <li>
        Return <code>Not Trusted</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>

  <h3 id="packaged-applications">Packaged Applications</h3>

  User agents that support packaged applications MAY whitelist specific URL
  schemes whose contents are authenticated by the user agent. For example,
  FirefoxOS application resources are referred to by a URL whose
  <code>scheme</code> component is <code>app:</code>. Likewise, Chrome's
  extensions and apps live on <code>chrome-extension:</code> schemes. These
  could reasonably be considered trusted origins.

  <h3 id="development-environments">Development Environments</h3>

  In order to support developers who run staging servers on non-loopback hosts,
  user agents MAY allow users to configure specific sets of origins as
  trustworthy, even though [[#is-origin-trustworthy]] would normally return
  <code>Not Trusted</code>.
